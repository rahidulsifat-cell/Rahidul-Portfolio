Portfolio Website – Rahidul Sifat
Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website created to showcase my profile as a UI/UX Designer.
The website highlights my introduction, skills, projects, education background, blog section, and a fully functional contact form connected to Google Sheets.

The design was first created in Figma and then implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS (CDN).
The website follows a modern dark theme with cyan glow effects and smooth scrolling navigation.
